The game board consisting of 5x5 cells, each of which can contain a piece of stone, and a set of colored (red and blue) stones. The first player plays with the red stones, the other with the blue stones. The board is initially empty. Players move in turn. In a move, a player must choose an empty cell and put a stone of his or her color into it. The game is over when a row, a column, or a diagonal contains 3 stones of the same color. (You must consider all possible diagonals, not only the main diagonal and the antidiagonal). The three stones do have to be adjacent. The player to which these stones belong loses the game.
